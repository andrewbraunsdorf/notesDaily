Memory
Malloc
Valgrind
Valgrind will help find memory leaks
Malloc allocates but if you don’t free it, you keep asking and then eventually it crashes

Accidently touch memory that you shouldn’t
Malloc assigns the address of a pointer, need to store that in a variable
Malloc you need stdlib.h library
C doesn’t scream when you go too far.
Technically wrong.
When you request memory, they give more memory you can technically reach it…it will work on your
You type valgrind ./filename it is a bunch of nonsense
You have to type help50 valgrind ./memory
Still the same amount of black and white input nonsense but at the end of it, you have a summary that addresses the issues
When you add malloc you have to free the memory after the issues
You have to free it after the issues
Have plenty of tools that you can use to modify your code
Command line arguments with valgrind
Rubber ducking 50, talk to the duck walking through your code and ‘

Text is the top of the program, it is running the program
It is when the 0s and 1s are loaded into RAM,
Moves quicker
when x and y were swapped they were stored in a temporary space and the space was then swapped but they only swapped the temporary values
when you stored them with pointers, it allowed them to swap with code
struct- design own data structures
we can implement our own features
struct.h
header files have code you want to share
{
char *name;
char *dorm;
}
Call structs with a .notation

Using arrays, downside of array, you cannot mix data types

Size cannot change
Int x[2]
You cannot fit a third object in it
You have to create a new array
So if you had 42, 13 you would need to make an array to add 50
You would take the same memory locations of 42 and 13 but also have to add 50

Effency of resizing an array, N represents n +1 to create a new array
If there is more needed
There is a function in c called realloc which allocates additional ram to the program
Realloc will, create a new array…however this is all linear
This all happens on the heap
Link list, elements point to other elements

Commit to a data structure and stick to it
Create another element, then another and another
When you use malloc 3 separate times, they are not being stored next to them…they might not even be proximate to each other
Create a link , pointer that is just an address
Now we have to store the memory of an item but also request slightly more memory to store the address of the next item
