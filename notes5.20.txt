Struct - contains certain values or keys that then equal certain values
Dot and bracket notation
Int is a data type
Now we can do RGBTRIPle aPixel;
aPixel.rgbtRed = 255;
aPixel.rgbtBlue = 255;
aPixel.rgbtGreen = 0;

Allows you to group together memory
All together it is a data structure.
Define at the top of the file

int* intPtr =5;
*intptr = 5;

You can declare and define above the main function
Modify the instance not the actual variables
If you want to modify the variable you can use a pointer

int* intPointer now stores a memory address
char* charPointer,
If you put an ambersand
It is going to give you the address of it

int* intPointer = &b is creating pointer
*intPointer += 4; is access the memory address
