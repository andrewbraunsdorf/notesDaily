Typdedef struct

    BYTE rgbtBlue;
    BYTE rgbtGreen;
    BYTE rgbtRed;

Int main (void)

	R = 255;
	B = 255;
	G = 0;


Struct - contains certain values or keys that then equal certain values
Dot and bracket notation
Int is a data type
Now we can do RGBTRIPle aPixel;
aPixel.rgbtRed = 255;
aPixel.rgbtBlue = 255;
aPixel.rgbtGreen = 0;

Allows you to group together memory
All together it is a data structure.
Define at the top of the file

int* intPtr =5;
*intptr = 5;

You can declare and define above the main function
Modify the instance not the actual variables
If you want to modify the variable you can use a pointer

int* intPointer now stores a memory address
char* charPointer,
If you put an ambersand
It is going to give you the address of it

int* intPointer = &b is creating pointer
*intPointer += 4; is access the memory address

& says give me the address of the variable
Length list, can create a list and point to the next one on the list
Can keep tacking on to the end
Reread line to finish and come back
Bitmaps are in multiple of 4.
Padding comes in 4
You need modulo
Int padding
Identify bitmap
Use the staffs solution by printing out results
Then ran through the multiplier, using the staffâ€™s solution

If you do not do your padding correct it will look funky, your padding is messed up

Size of int is 4
I know i need this much space from memory
