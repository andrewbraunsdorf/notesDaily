Lecture 3
Computer Science
Have to preprocess computer
Have to actually compile
 Take source code and make assembly code
Take cs50.h and stdio.h
Printf.c
Where the code actually is and merge the 0s and 1s that make the process possible
More help then help50, printf, and style50
Help50 will help you understand what the code is that is being processed
Cs50ide is a more powerful too of what we will be using
More features that help you solve problems with your code
Umbuto linux.  IDE saves everything

. is current file
Files with an asterisk means its executable
Rmdir is remove directory
Can use check50, checks correctness of file
Check50 expects cs50/2019/fall/hello
Debugger, helps remove bugs
Using debugger, compile, then debug50 <name of file>
Debut 50  ./hello
