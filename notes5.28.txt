Typedef struct
{
	Int value
	Node * next
} Node

Node first
Node second
Access bitmapinfoheader using .notation

Access keys of struct
Access arrowed
first . next = second (this does not work)
First => next

printf(“biwidth%i\n”, bi.biWidth);
printf(“biheight%i\n”, bi.biHeight);
printf(“bisizeimage%i\n”, bi.biSizeImage);

bi.biWidth += 1;

printf(“biwidth%i\n”, bi.biWidth);

Width x height
8 * 8 =64 then base 3 =192 technically does +0 for padding because it is already base 4’
3 * 3 = 9 then *3 = 27 but this does not equal the same
The answer is always multiple of 4
Bisizeimage is the pixels plus your padding

As it reads it reads and changes the curser. Moving the curser through the file
Reading every byte

Smiley width is 8 by 8, but you are -1, the row is not being scanned
Operating system does ready all the data it is just creating a 7 by 8 structure

Just accessing memory C doesnt know if we are putting bad data onto the memory.
Fread and fwrite
Raw binary values
Not wrong according to C.
If it is stored as a negative number may want to keep it negative

Get 50 numbers which one is largest, store in an int and then compare to the next numbers
How a computer
