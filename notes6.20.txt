Stacks plates
Grab plates from top
Last in first out
Queues waiting in lines
LIFO and FIFO
Push and Pop due to the queue and stack systems

Add 10 straight to the queue, tell the child nodes again, 8 and 15
Because we had a pointer at 15 we can go to it, then add them to the list.  Print out 15.

It would be an interesting printout if you wanted to go out through the stack,
You can pop from the front and push from the end
 Link list and can change the front of your linked list
We can potentially run out of space.

Do you have a child node to itself
Cant have a high node so free itself
Dont have a low or high node so free itself
So print everything in a row.

Need apostre so we need 27.
Ascii value we can automatically make it the last item in the array
The true false

Hash table need a array of pointers that connect to a linked list

Trie is a bunch of nodes that has pointers
But more of a ton of pointers
