Hello
Mario L
Cash

Can also do M and Credit
Cost analysis on time versus work
Watch go through problems
Go ahead and then help fellow students
Rewatch or review.

Mario 4, print top row and bottom row
Height of 4
All text sames the same amount of space
Fonts now are more proportional
In terms and systems, old ones take up the same amount of space

Row numbers all equal 4
   #
Technically building two triangles one empty triangle and one triangle with hashtags
Start at 3 and go down to 0
Reverse for loop

Looping structures in C
Do while- always runs once, (checks the code at the end)
While
For- (set # of iterations that should occur) iterating through data and counting

Do while-
Do while it is occuring

While- condition is true
Height is between a certain range

Cash improsion
1.47, we can have issues
Causes improcion, floating point math procise
How to turn 1.47 into non-floating point math… you multiply by 100.
Can you round numbers in C, rounds to the first whole number
round(1.47*100)
147 -25 (it is integer based math)

“5137” in js convert to string, split then pop

How to get 7 in C, take advantage of tools
Mod 100 gives last 2 digits,
%100 then % 10 gives last number .7
In C 513.7 /10 it equals 513
For pop have to use mod 10 and then divide by 10


style50 will tell you what is wrong with your style
style50 filename
style50 func.c
Always create a structural file

Void does not return anything

Function must be declared before it is used (if not it doesnt know what to use)
Does it require parameters
We can do it like JS

This does not run in C
int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello\n");
    printSum();
}

void printSum(void)
{
    printf("1 + 2 = %i\n", 1 + 2);
}

This Will run in C

void printSum(void); //has to be above the print sum

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello\n");
    printSum();
}

void printSum(void)
{
    printf("1 + 2 = %i\n", 1 + 2);
}

Explicit void is more important in more complex systems

DRY-Don’t repeat yourself
