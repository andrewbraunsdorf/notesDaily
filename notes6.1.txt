Recover: getting chunks of data.
Any chunk you grab.
When you find the first 4 chunks, you throw chunks in there until it starts with the first 4 bytes again

How do we objectify this?

Pset 4
Speller: spell checking file
Dictionary  text
Speller dictionary text

Using malloc
Cat
Caterpillar
Hat
Txt document is play, take document,
Get words into memory, then check words to see if they work
If word is not spelled in dictionary it is wrong
Will take hat and hat’s if in the dictionary
Check to see if word is in dictionary...but say apple, its not in dictionary

Had an array, have an array of words
[“cat”, “caterpillar”, “hat”, “hat’s]
To search for it search through using an array
Arrays have set lengths
Trie and hash table

Trie works as having several node with more branches to more does

Hash table=>
hat=> 71
0-80 it will always return the same #
But the word cat might give you the word 71

0-
22- Hat’s
52- Caterpillar
71 - Hat Cat

Hash table divides them into subsection
How many boxes do you create with how many boxes into subsection
Use malloc, but then also need to use free
Need to remove free in a particular order

Use pointers and a linked list

An array with 5 boxes
Int Array[i]
Address + (sizeof(type) * i)
Address is 0x123
0- 0x123
1- 0x127
2- 0x131
3- 0x135
4- 0x139
5- 0x143
6- 0x147

Address + (sizeof(type) * i)
0x123 + (sizeof(int) * 3)
0x123  + (4*3)
0x123 +12
0x135
