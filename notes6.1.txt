Txt document is play, take document,
Get words into memory, then check words to see if they work
If word is not spelled in dictionary it is wrong
Will take hat and hat’s if in the dictionary
Check to see if word is in dictionary...but say apple, its not in dictionary

Had an array, have an array of words
[“cat”, “caterpillar”, “hat”, “hat’s]
To search for it search through using an array
Arrays have set lengths
Trie and hash table

Trie works as having several node with more branches to more does

Hash table=>
hat=> 71
0-80 it will always return the same #
But the word cat might give you the word 71

0-
22- Hat’s
52- Caterpillar
71 - Hat Cat
