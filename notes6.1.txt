Recover: getting chunks of data.
Any chunk you grab.
When you find the first 4 chunks, you throw chunks in there until it starts with the first 4 bytes again

How do we objectify this?

Pset 4
Speller: spell checking file
Dictionary  text
Speller dictionary text

Using malloc
Cat
Caterpillar
Hat
Txt document is play, take document,
Get words into memory, then check words to see if they work
If word is not spelled in dictionary it is wrong
Will take hat and hat’s if in the dictionary
Check to see if word is in dictionary...but say apple, its not in dictionary

Had an array, have an array of words
[“cat”, “caterpillar”, “hat”, “hat’s]
To search for it search through using an array
Arrays have set lengths
Trie and hash table

Trie works as having several node with more branches to more does

Hash table=>
hat=> 71
0-80 it will always return the same #
But the word cat might give you the word 71

0-
22- Hat’s
52- Caterpillar
71 - Hat Cat

Hash table divides them into subsection
How many boxes do you create with how many boxes into subsection
Use malloc, but then also need to use free
Need to remove free in a particular order

Use pointers and a linked list

An array with 5 boxes
Int Array[i]
Address + (sizeof(type) * i)
Address is 0x123
0- 0x123
1- 0x127
2- 0x131
3- 0x135
4- 0x139
5- 0x143
6- 0x147

Address + (sizeof(type) * i)
0x123 + (sizeof(int) * 3)
0x123  + (4*3)
0x123 +12
0x135

C is all about efficiency and memory management

Input stream
8
7
10
5
Store 8 in a block of memory
Store 7 in a block of memory and have 9=8 point to 7
Then store 10 in a box and have 7 point to it
Store 5 in a box and have 10 point to it
Have to start at 8 then to 7 then to 10 and then to 5
(unfortunately you have to go through them in

You have to store the address.  Each of them has an extra piece of memory that stores to the next person.

If you want to remove 7 … you can tell 8 to point to 10, and it removes 7 from the list
4 byte for memory address

Created a temp guy, so then you can reference the temp pointer from 10 to 5, and then you can point from 5 to 10
Now have
You can have a box pointing to a box, then you have boxes that also point back to the previous box.
You are using much more memory to go back
How can we organize our data in unique ways

Why choose forward and backward data structure.
You can find certain items, and then reset your points at a particular point. Then filter through from a point
How can we organize data in certain ways?
It can make the data better

# and pointer are linked together
Combine two different data types
You use structs
Had 2 different data structs
Stored 2 different types into different entities
Nodes on a list or nodes on a tree
Create our own struct called a notes
